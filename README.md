# CXL Content

Clixell Content is a shopify app that makes creating content pages on your store super easy.

## What can Clixell Content do?

Have a content page you would like to add to your store? For example an FAQs page or a featured products page. Clixell Content will allow you to add:

### Custom text

Add whatever header, subheader, description and anything else you need to your page using the textboxes and TinyMCE textareas. You can format the text to be any style, colour and create any layout you like.

### Images 

Upload images to be displayed in the frontend. Some examples of types of images you could add are thumbnails, jumbotrons and galleries.

### Tags

Add tags to your content. Tags will link to other articles that share the same tag. 

### Downloads

Add downloadable content to your shopify store

### Meta fields

Add a Meta title and meta description to your content pages

### Data through ajax

You can bring your data in using an ajax request so that you don't have to call the app directly through the url.
