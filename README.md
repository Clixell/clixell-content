# CXL Content

Clixell Content is a shopify app that makes creating content pages on your store super easy.

## What can Clixell Content do?

Have a content page you would like to add to your store? For example an FAQs page or a featured products page. Clixell Content will allow you to add:

### Custom text

You can add whatever header, subheader, description and anything else you need to your page using the textboxes and TinyMCE textareas. Simply give the text type a name and call it in your view. You can format the text to be any style, colour and have any page align you like.

### Images 

You can upload images in the admin section and call them on the frontend. If you are creating a listing page for the content type, you can add a thumbnail to each article within the content type and it will show within the listing page.

### Gallery of images

You can upload multiple images that will be grouped together and displayed as a gallery in the frontend.

### Tags

You can add tags to your content page which will be clickable and link to other articles within the content type that share the same tag. 

### Downloads

You can add downloadable content to your page. If you would like your customers to be able to download PDFs, Text Documents, images and more, then you simple upload the document to the backend and call it in the frontend. You will be able to give the download whatever name you like and have it appear however you wish in the frontend.

### Links

Create links to redirect the user to other pages on the site or to other places of interest

### Meta fields

Add a Meta title and description to your content pages

### Data through ajax

You can bring your data in using an ajax request so that you don't have to call the app directly through the url.
