# Tags

You can add tags to your articles that allow them to be linked to other articles with the same tag.

## How to add tags to your articles

Go into the config for the content type you would like to add tags to, and click the "show tags" checkbox in the options section.

Tags will appear in the main settings. You can check and uncheck which tags you would like to have included.

You can add new tags by adding them in the text box and separating each tag with a comma.

## What do tags do?

You can use tags to link certain products together. For example, if I were to click the "fashion" tag in the first example, I would be
taken to a new listings page with other products that share this same tag.
