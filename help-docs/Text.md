# Text

You can add as much custom text as you like to any content page

## Text attributes

You can use text attributes to display short snippets of text/numeric values on your content pages

### Text snippets

A text snippet would be something like the following subheader, "the best suites on the web":

![alt text](https://github.com/clixell/clixell-content/blob/master/help-docs/images/text-snippet-example.png)

Start by creating a new text attribute:

![alt text](https://github.com/clixell/clixell-content/blob/master/help-docs/images/how-to-text-snippet-1.png)

Go to the content type and fill the new text attribute with the details you would like:

![alt text](https://github.com/clixell/clixell-content/blob/master/help-docs/images/how-to-text-snippet-2.png)

Use the following code to retrieve the snippet:

`<h3>{{ content_subheader }}</h3>`
