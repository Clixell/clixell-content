  ## Image GET variables

  You may have noticed the variable "crop" in the image src. There are two options you can pass in when pulling out an image, "crop" and "fit".

  ### Crop

  Crop will crop the image to fit the size specified.

  ### Fit

  Fit will force the image to fit the box specified.
